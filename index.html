    <h3>Welcome to Pig Dice, the classic gaming sensation that's sweeping the nation. </h3>

    <p class="introText">Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold": </p>
    <ul id="introList">
      

      <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
      <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
      <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
      <li>The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, the first player, Ann, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Ann could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again. Ann rolls a 1, and must end her turn without scoring. The next player, Bob, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which he chooses to hold, and adds his turn total of 22 points to his score.</p>
